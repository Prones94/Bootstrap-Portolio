                        <p>My name is Ian! US Air Force veteran, currently working on
                            becoming a future web developer and travel the world.
                            I currently know three languages: Japanese, Tagalog (mostly because of I'm Filipino and my parents wanted me
                            to be cultured), and English. Hobbies include working out, hiking, and my newest hobby and hopefully leads to more: photography.
                            I really enjoy trying new foods and recreating them in my own kitchen when I have the chance. I have one cat, 
                            his name is DJ who constantly loves to annoy me when I eat, work on projects, pretty much anytime I'm home since he has seperation anxiety.
                        </p>
                        <p>My journey into coding began while I was in the military, around 2015. My mother-in-law asked me a simple question: What would I do outside of the military? Which led to a few weeks scratching and worrying about our future. And accidentally while I was on FaceBook I saw an ad for a coding bootcamp in Seattle. 
                            Curiously enough, it got me thinking, as I love to work on my computer after work. Fast-forward a few years and moving around and some smart money decisions finally led myself to apply for a bootcamp. I am also going to school to receive my bachelors' in Computer Science.
